# discordbot
Add discord.js to repl.it through the packages tab.
Add code from file "starting_code" to "index.js" in repl.it.
You may notice that we need to put a token into the bottom line.
We have to get the token after creating the discord bot through discord.
https://discord.com/developers/applications Click this link.
Click new application. Then name your bot and press create.
On the left, click the bot tab, then click add bot.
There will be a section below the name of your bot called "Token". This is the password to your bot, do not share it with anyone.
Click copy under "Token", then place it in repl.it where it says token. 
Then go to the general information tab in the bot settings and copy the client ID.
https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#8 Then follow this link to add your bot to a server of your choice. You can just generally just enable administrator. Then paste the client ID where it asks for it, and click the link at the bottom of the page. Add the discord bot to the server.
Then run the code in repl.it, and your bot should go online. The index.js is where you can manage and edit the code and abilities.
If you want to test out your bot, type "ping" into the disocrd chat with the bot, and it should respond.
